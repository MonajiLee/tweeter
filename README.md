# Tweeter Project

Tweeter ("Squeeker") is a simple, single-page Twitter clone built with front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX) and back-end (Node, Express, MongoDB) skills.

As a part of the web development curriculum at Lighthouse Labs (YVR), this was an individual evaluated project built over five days.
